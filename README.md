# PiStormAGS

This is a script to convert the WinUAE or AGA versions of AGS 3.0 to work with Pistorm. 

While developed on Pistorm32lite, the WinUAE version should also work on non AGA Amiga PiStorm machines if you don't try and run AGA games and don't try switching the AGS Launcher into a AGA screenmode. Because the screenshots are all in 128 colours and the themes are in 256 colours there is no easy way to make this work on non-RTG ECS/OCS PiStormed Amigas.

Changes made to offical build:

- Fixes made to various scripts to allow this to work with PiStorm
- RTG is setup to work with PiStorm 
- The WHDLoadWrapper is installed
- Wifipi.device and genet.device are included
- Scripts have been added to the S/PiStorm folder to help get you online

To use the script, run the 'RunThisAGSGenerator.ps1' shortcut. It will elevate priviliges and give you the following:
